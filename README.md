## 🌍 About Suyana

Suyana is revolutionizing climate insurance with affordable, reliable, and scalable solutions. Our name means "hope" in Quechua, reflecting our commitment to empowering communities with the tools to safeguard their livelihoods against climate change.

Using satellite data and machine learning, we provide parametric insurance where payouts are activated automatically by predefined weather triggers rather than lengthy damage assessments. This innovative approach provides fast, transparent coverage against floods, droughts, and coastal hazards, addressing the urgent need for accessible climate insurance.

## 🌱 Our Mission

To make climate protection accessible and affordable for all. We aim to bridge the climate protection gap and build resilience against natural disasters by providing innovative, data-driven insurance solutions.
